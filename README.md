# An example of web application with spring-boot
In this example, we created a containerless web application. We used spring-boot but its auto-configuration because of it's exausting loading time. We only loaded or created the Beans which we need.

### Technology stacks:
- Maven
- Spring-boot
- Spring-MVC
- Embedded Tomcat
